    "In a nutshell, neutral atom devices feature two main components:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The **Register**, a group of trapped atoms in a defined (but\n",
    "    reconfigurable) configuration. Each atom holds a specific quantum\n",
    "    state encoded in specific electronic levels. Usually these are\n",
    "    two-level systems and we refer to them as *qubits*.\n",
    "-   The **Channels**, responsible for manipulating the state of the\n",
    "    atoms by addressing specific electronic transitions. These consist\n",
    "    most often, but not exclusively, of lasers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each **Device** will impose specific restrictions on these components\n",
    "\\-- they define things like how many atoms a Register can hold and in\n",
    "what configurations they can be arranged in; what channels are available\n",
    "and what values they can reach, among others. For this reason, a\n",
    "**Sequence** is closely dependent on the **Device** it is meant to run\n",
    "on and should be created with it in mind from the start.\n",
    "\n",
    "This **Sequence** is the central object in Pulser and it consists\n",
    "essentially of a series of **Pulses** (and other instructions) that are\n",
    "sequentially allocated to channels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each **Pulse** describes, over a finite duration, the modulation of a\n",
    "channel\\'s output *amplitude*, *detuning* and *phase*. While the phase\n",
    "is constant throughout a pulse, the amplitude and detuning are described\n",
    "by **Waveforms**, which define these quantities values throughout the\n",
    "pulse.\n",
    "\n",
    "<figure>\n",
    "<img src=\"../files/pulser_animation.gif\" class=\"align-center\"\n",
    "alt=\"../files/pulser_animation.gif\" />\n",
    "<figcaption>A pulse sequence and its execution on a given\n",
    "device.</figcaption>\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "In the animation above, we find an example of a Sequence composed of\n",
    "three channels, each containing different pulses played at specific\n",
    "times. Upon execution, the channels emit this coordinated stream of\n",
    "pulses, which manipulate the state of the atoms in the register.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, what is left to know is *how* these channels manipulate the state\n",
    "the atoms so that we can program them to do meaningful things. To do\n",
    "this, we have to dive into the physics and try to understand the\n",
    "underlying **Hamiltonian** of our systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Driving two-level transitions\n",
    "\n",
    "Each channel is tuned such that each of its pulses coherently drives a\n",
    "specific electronic transition between two energy levels of an atom. For\n",
    "instance, when addressing the `ground-rydberg` transition, we have that\n",
    "our targeted levels are the ground state, $|g\\rangle$, and the Rydberg\n",
    "state, $|r\\rangle$. These two states can be thought of as the two levels\n",
    "of a quantum spin.\n",
    "\n",
    "![The ground and Rydberg levels become the states of a spin system.](../files/ground_rydberg.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this system, a pulse acting on an atom $i$, with **Rabi frequency**\n",
    "$\\Omega(t)$, **detuning** $\\delta(t)$ and a fixed phase $\\phi$, will\n",
    "have the Hamiltonian terms:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\hbar\\Omega(t)}{2} (\\cos(\\phi)\\sigma_i^x - \\sin(\\phi)\\sigma_i^y) - \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\delta(t) \\sigma_i^z,$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\sigma^\\alpha$ for $\\alpha = x,y,z$ are the Pauli matrices.\n",
    "Alternatively, one can rewrite this term as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\mathbf{\\Omega}(t)\\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_i,$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where\n",
    "$\\mathbf{\\Omega}(t) = (\\Omega(t) \\cos(\\phi),-\\Omega(t) \\sin(\\phi),-\\delta(t))^T$\n",
    "and $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ is the vector of Pauli matrices. In the Bloch\n",
    "sphere representation, for each instant $t$, this Hamiltonian describes\n",
    "a rotation around the axis $\\mathbf{\\Omega}$ with angular velocity\n",
    "$\\Omega_{eff} = |\\mathbf{\\Omega}| = \\sqrt{\\Omega^2 + \\delta^2}$, as\n",
    "illustrated in the figure below.\n",

    "![Representation of the dynamics induced by a pulse as a rotation in the\n",
    "Bloch sphere.](../files/bloch_rotation.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Rydberg states\n",
    "\n",
    "In neutral atom devices, atoms are driven to Rydberg states as a way to\n",
    "make them interact over large distances. The interaction between two\n",
    "atoms at distance $R$ and at the same Rydberg level is described by the\n",
    "**Van der Waals force**, which scales as $R^{-6}$. This interaction can\n",
    "be exploited to create fast and robust quantum gates, using the\n",
    "so-called **Rydberg Blockade Effect** between them. This effect consists\n",
    "on the shift in energy between the doubly excited Rydberg state of\n",
    "nearby atoms and their ground state, making it non-resonant with an\n",
    "applied laser field coupling the ground and Rydberg levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "![There is no simultaneous transition to the doubly excited state inside the blockade radius.](../files/ryd_block.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of the Rydberg blockade, an atom cannot be excited to the\n",
    "Rydberg level if a nearby atom is already in such state. To represent\n",
    "this interaction as operators in a Hamiltonian, we write them as a\n",
    "penalty for the state in which both atoms are excited:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$U_{ij} n_i n_j,$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $n = (1+\\sigma^z)/2$ is the projector on the Rydberg state,\n",
    "$U_{ij} \\propto R_{ij}^{-6}$ and $R_{ij}$ is the distance between the\n",
    "atoms $i$ and $j$. The proportionality constant is set by the chosen\n",
    "Rydberg level. If the atoms are excited simultaneously, only the\n",
    "entangled state $(|gr\\rangle + |rg\\rangle)/\\sqrt 2$ is obtained.\n",
    "\n",
    "An entire array of interacting atoms, acted on by the same pulse, can be\n",
    "represented as an Ising-like Hamiltonian:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$H = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sum_i  \\Omega_i(t) \\sigma_i^x - \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sum_i\n",
    "\\delta(t) \\sigma_i^z + \\sum_{i<j} U_{ij} n_i n_j$$\n",
    "\n",
    "# Digital and Analog Approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "## Analog Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "In the analog simulation approach, the laser field acts on the entire\n",
    "array of atoms. This creates a **global** Hamiltonian of the form\n",
    "\n",
    "$$H = \\sum_i \\left( \\frac{\\hbar\\Omega(t)}{2} \\sigma_i^x - \\frac{\\hbar\\delta(t)}{2}\n",
    "\\sigma_i^z + \\sum_{j<i} U_{ij} n_i n_j \\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Through the continuous manipulation of $\\Omega(t)$ and $\\delta(t)$, one\n",
    "has a very high degree of control over the system\\'s dynamics and\n",
    "properties. In this way, the analog approach enables the quantum\n",
    "simulation of many-body quantum systems, but also provides novel ways of\n",
    "solving combinatorial problems that can be mapped onto the hamiltonian\n",
    "above.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Digital Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "In opposition to the analog approach stands the digital approach, in\n",
    "which a system\\'s state evolves through a series of discrete\n",
    "manipulations of its qubits\\' states, also known as quantum gates. This\n",
    "is the underlying approach in quantum circuits and it can be replicated\n",
    "on neutral-atom devices at the pulse-level. To this extent, the qubit\n",
    "states are encoded in two hyperfine ground states of the system, named\n",
    "[ground]{.title-ref}, $|g\\rangle$, and [hyperfine]{.title-ref},\n",
    "$|h\\rangle$. In Pulser, these states form the `digital` basis, which is\n",
    "addressed by `Raman` channels. In the digital approach, these channels\n",
    "are usually [Local]{.title-ref}, meaning they target individual qubits\n",
    "instead of the entire system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the Rydberg blockade effect is not present when atoms are in\n",
    "$|g\\rangle$ or $|h\\rangle$, the dynamics of each qubit\\'s state are just\n",
    "determined by the driving pulses, already illustrated above as rotations\n",
    "on the Bloch sphere. By tuning the parameters of a pulse, we can achieve\n",
    "any arbitrary single-qubit unitary, as is shown in\n",
    "`tutorials/phase_shifts_vz_gates`{.interpreted-text role=\"doc\"}.\n",
    "\n",
    "![The three levels involved in the digital-level approach.](../files/digital.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "However, without the interaction introduced by the Rydberg blockade\n",
    "effect, it is not possible to do multi-qubit gates. Therefore, the\n",
    "Rydberg level is used ancillarily in order to generate a conditional\n",
    "logic on the atoms by attempting an excitation which will be blocked (or\n",
    "not) depending on the distance and current levels of the involved atoms.\n",
    "This is the key behind the [CZ gate]{.title-ref}, whose implementation\n",
    "is detailed in `tutorials/cz_gate`{.interpreted-text role=\"doc\"}.\n"
