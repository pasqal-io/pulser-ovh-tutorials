Today, the control of single atoms as well as the tuning\nof their interactions has been achieved to a high degree in several\nlaboratories. One of the leading architectures for constructing these\n*programmable* devices consists in arranging ensembles of individual\n(trapped) atoms separated by a few micrometers. In order to generate\ninteractions between them, they are excited by a resonant laser field to\na **Rydberg level**, which has a large principal quantum number. At the\nRydberg state, the atoms present long lifetimes and large interaction\nstrengths and are briefly called **Rydberg atoms**.\n\nThis page gives brief insight into the concepts behind **Pulser** and\nthe use of neutral-atom devices for quantum computation and simulation.\nFor more details, see [Quantum 4, 327\n(2020)](https://quantum-journal.org/papers/q-2020-09-21-327/) for a\ncomprehensive overview of quantum computing with neutral atoms, [Nature\nPhysics volume 16,\npages132--142(2020)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-019-0733-z)\nfor a review that\\'s more focused on their use as a quantum simulation,\nor even [M Saffman 2016 J.

Phys. 49\n202001](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0953-4075/49/20/202001).\n\n# Implementation and Theoretical Details\n\n## Hardware Characteristics\n\nIn a nutshell, neutral atom devices feature two main components:\n\n-   The **Register**, a group of trapped atoms in a defined (but\n    reconfigurable) configuration. Each atom holds a specific quantum\n    state encoded in specific electronic levels. Usually these are\n    two-level systems and we refer to them as *qubits*.\n-   The **Channels**, responsible for manipulating the state of the\n    atoms by addressing specific electronic transitions. These consist\n    most often, but not exclusively, of lasers.\n\nEach **Device** will impose specific restrictions on these components\n\\-- they define things like how many atoms a Register can hold and in\nwhat configurations they can be arranged in; what channels are available\nand what values they can reach, among others. For this reason, a\n**Sequence** is closely dependent on the **Device** it is meant to run\non and should be created with it in mind from the start.\n\nThis **Sequence** is the central object in Pulser and it consists\nessentially of a series of **Pulses** (and other instructions) that are\nsequentially allocated to channels.\n\nEach **Pulse** describes, over a finite duration, the modulation of a\nchannel\\'s output *amplitude*, *detuning* and *phase*. While the phase\nis constant throughout a pulse, the amplitude and detuning are described\nby **Waveforms**, which define these quantities values throughout the\npulse.\n\n<figure>\n<img src=\"../files/pulser_animation.gif\" class=\"align-center\"\nalt=\"../files/pulser_animation.gif\" />\n<figcaption>A pulse sequence and its execution on a given\ndevice.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nIn the animation above, we find an example of a Sequence composed of\nthree channels, each containing different pulses played at specific\ntimes. Upon execution, the channels emit this coordinated stream of\npulses, which manipulate the state of the atoms in the register.\n\nNow, what is left to know is *how* these channels manipulate the state\nthe atoms so that we can program them to do meaningful things. To do\nthis, we have to dive into the physics and try to understand the\nunderlying **Hamiltonian** of our systems.\n\n## Driving two-level transitions\n\nEach channel is tuned such that each of its pulses coherently drives a\nspecific electronic transition between two energy levels of an atom. For\ninstance, when addressing the `ground-rydberg` transition, we have that\nour targeted levels are the ground state, $|g\\rangle$, and the Rydberg\nstate, $|r\\rangle$. These two states can be thought of as the two levels\nof a quantum spin.\n\n![The ground and Rydberg levels become the states of a spin system.](../files/ground_rydberg.png)\n\nIn this system, a pulse acting on an atom $i$, with **Rabi frequency**\n$\\Omega(t)$, **detuning** $\\delta(t)$ and a fixed phase $\\phi$, will\nhave the Hamiltonian terms:\n\n$$\\frac{\\hbar\\Omega(t)}{2} (\\cos(\\phi)\\sigma_i^x - \\sin(\\phi)\\sigma_i^y) - \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\delta(t) \\sigma_i^z,$$\n\nwhere $\\sigma^\\alpha$ for $\\alpha = x,y,z$ are the Pauli matrices.\nAlternatively, one can rewrite this term as:\n\n$$\\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\mathbf{\\Omega}(t)\\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_i,$$\n\nwhere\n$\\mathbf{\\Omega}(t) = (\\Omega(t) \\cos(\\phi),-\\Omega(t) \\sin(\\phi),-\\delta(t))^T$\nand $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ is the vector of Pauli matrices. In the Bloch\nsphere representation, for each instant $t$, this Hamiltonian describes\na rotation around the axis $\\mathbf{\\Omega}$ with angular velocity\n$\\Omega_{eff} = |\\mathbf{\\Omega}| = \\sqrt{\\Omega^2 + \\delta^2}$, as\nillustrated in the figure below.\n\n![Representation of the dynamics induced by a pulse as a rotation in the\nBloch sphere.](../files/bloch_rotation.png)\n\n## Rydberg states\n\nIn neutral atom devices, atoms are driven to Rydberg states as a way to\nmake them interact over large distances. The interaction between two\natoms at distance $R$ and at the same Rydberg level is described by the\n**Van der Waals force**, which scales as $R^{-6}$. This interaction can\nbe exploited to create fast and robust quantum gates, using the\nso-called **Rydberg Blockade Effect** between them. This effect consists\non the shift in energy between the doubly excited Rydberg state of\nnearby atoms and their ground state, making it non-resonant with an\napplied laser field coupling the ground and Rydberg levels.\n\n![There is no simultaneous transition to the doubly excited state inside the blockade radius.](../files/ryd_block.png)\n\nBecause of the Rydberg blockade, an atom cannot be excited to the\nRydberg level if a nearby atom is already in such state. To represent\nthis interaction as operators in a Hamiltonian, we write them as a\npenalty for the state in which both atoms are excited:\n\n$$U_{ij} n_i n_j,$$\n\nwhere $n = (1+\\sigma^z)/2$ is the projector on the Rydberg state,\n$U_{ij} \\propto R_{ij}^{-6}$ and $R_{ij}$ is the distance between the\natoms $i$ and $j$. The proportionality constant is set by the chosen\nRydberg level. If the atoms are excited simultaneously, only the\nentangled state $(|gr\\rangle + |rg\\rangle)/\\sqrt 2$ is obtained.\n\nAn entire array of interacting atoms, acted on by the same pulse, can be\nrepresented as an Ising-like Hamiltonian:\n\n$$H = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sum_i  \\Omega_i(t) \\sigma_i^x - \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sum_i\n\\delta(t) \\sigma_i^z + \\sum_{i<j} U_{ij} n_i n_j$$\n\n# Digital and Analog Approaches\n\n## Analog Approach\n\nIn the analog simulation approach, the laser field acts on the entire\narray of atoms. This creates a **global** Hamiltonian of the form\n\n$$H = \\sum_i \\left( \\frac{\\hbar\\Omega(t)}{2} \\sigma_i^x - \\frac{\\hbar\\delta(t)}{2}\n\\sigma_i^z + \\sum_{j<i} U_{ij} n_i n_j \\right)$$\n\nThrough the continuous manipulation of $\\Omega(t)$ and $\\delta(t)$, one\nhas a very high degree of control over the system\\'s dynamics and\nproperties. In this way, the analog approach enables the quantum\nsimulation of many-body quantum systems, but also provides novel ways of\nsolving combinatorial problems that can be mapped onto the hamiltonian\nabove.\n\n## Digital Approach\n\nIn opposition to the analog approach stands the digital approach, in\nwhich a system\\'s state evolves through a series of discrete\nmanipulations of its qubits\\' states, also known as quantum gates. This\nis the underlying approach in quantum circuits and it can be replicated\non neutral-atom devices at the pulse-level. To this extent, the qubit\nstates are encoded in two hyperfine ground states of the system, named\n[ground]{.title-ref}, $|g\\rangle$, and [hyperfine]{.title-ref},\n$|h\\rangle$. In Pulser, these states form the `digital` basis, which is\naddressed by `Raman` channels. In the digital approach, these channels\nare usually [Local]{.title-ref}, meaning they target individual qubits\ninstead of the entire system.\n\nSince the Rydberg blockade effect is not present when atoms are in\n$|g\\rangle$ or $|h\\rangle$, the dynamics of each qubit\\'s state are just\ndetermined by the driving pulses, already illustrated above as rotations\non the Bloch sphere. By tuning the parameters of a pulse, we can achieve\nany arbitrary single-qubit unitary, as is shown in\n`tutorials/phase_shifts_vz_gates`{.interpreted-text role=\"doc\"}.\n\n![The three levels involved in the digital-level approach.](../files/digital.png)\n\nHowever, without the interaction introduced by the Rydberg blockade\neffect, it is not possible to do multi-qubit gates. Therefore, the\nRydberg level is used ancillarily in order to generate a conditional\nlogic on the atoms by attempting an excitation which will be blocked (or\nnot) depending on the distance and current levels of the involved atoms.\nThis is the key behind the [CZ gate]{.title-ref}, whose implementation\nis detailed in `tutorials/cz_gate`{.interpreted-text role=\"doc\"}.\n", "params": {}}
